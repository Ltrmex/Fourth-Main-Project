Transformers,"Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?","Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen.-Revenge of the Fallen was so bad.-The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.-I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting.-The story line itself was a mess.-I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise.-Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.-That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films.-I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.-I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent.-Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.-I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?-Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest.-John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role.-I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing."

no way, how does that happen I wonder
I dont know, we will see this weekend
I cant wait

Hard,I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.,The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.-I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.-Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.-I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.-If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.-I think i remember that movie.-Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.-Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.-Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.-There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.

What,What is your favorite action movie?,"My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.-That's an interesting choice.-How so?-Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.-I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.-That's true, he never killed an innocent person.-Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.-I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.-Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film."
Charles,DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?,"Sure, all the ""Death Wish"" series.-Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.-He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.-The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.-That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.-He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.-Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.-The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.-In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.-That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.-It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!"
Suburban,You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.,"I've never heard of it.-What's it about?-Oh it's great.-Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.-This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.-It is!-But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great.-They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.-Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?-Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.-Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.-It is so worth it though.-The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.-That just sounds despicable."

Max,I think Mad Max is probably the best action film in a long time.,"It's up there.-It's basically a nonstop car chase.-I was a bit disappointed that it didn't win more Oscars.-It's kind of tough for a film like that to win outside of some technical categories.-But it was very deserving.-Great performances, great direction...-But it's not really the type of movie to convince the academy.-Do they have any plans for a sequel?-Not that I've heard.-Might be a few years if it did happen.-I'll be first in line when it's released if it's released.-I'll be right there with you."

The,Did you see The Road to Perdition?,"Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised

The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.-My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning ""I am glad it was you""

Did,Did you see doctor strange yet?,"I finally got around to watching it
weren't the space time bending effects insane?-yeah , that part where doctor strange has the cloak ""come to him"" was crazy
he got totally lucky in that scene as the bad guys had him outnumbered
what did you think of that time-loop sequence at the end
that was unreal.-that was pretty creative way for strange to get the upper hand
I know , right.-that was amazing!-I really hope they make a sequel soon
I have no doubt that they will"
Dark,Would you rate Dark Knight as the best action movie of all time?,No because it was an action movie but it wasnt at the same time.-In what respect?-You didnt NEED blowing up and fighting for that movie to be good.-So it was more of a thriller?-It did a good job of combinging the two.-That makes it all the more fun.-Ledger acted the heck out of his role.-Bale was a great complementary piece in that one.-Its a shame they couldnt do another one since we dont know if The Joker died.
Do,Do you like action films?,"Yes, very much.-Which one is your favorite?-The Matrix

Point,"What did you think of the remake of the movie ""Point Break""?","I wasn't happy at first, just because I think Hollywood needs to chill out with remaking great old movies, but after watching the remake I thought it was pretty good.-I couldn't agree more.-I can't picture Point Break without Keanu Reeves acting at Johnny Utah but the remake followed the orginal storyline pretty well.-The remake had just as much or even more action scenes then the orginial one that was released in 1991.-Can't believe the first one was released in 1991!-It's still a classic movie and one of my favorites.-Kathryn Bigelow did a fanstatic job directing the orginial Point Break, as an audience member, the film really throws you into Johnny Utah's extreme life.-Speaking of extreme, how bout that skydiving scene in the first movie?-I love that scene.-When Johnny Utah jumps out the airplane with no parachute to catch Bodhi?-Yeah man, I doubt that would be possible in real life but it sure looked good on the big screen.-Sometimes I wish I lived a life like Johnny Utah.-I dressed up as one of the dead presidents for halloween a few years ago."

and those fighting skills too
The fights were crazy cool"
True,You remember that True Lies movie?,"From way back when.-1994 I think.-Yeah.-That was a pretty solid movie though.-I remember Jamie Lee Curtis was in it as his wife.-Which seems weird as she doesn't seem like a sex symbol.-She actually looked pretty good in it where she had to wear that dress.Which
I appreciated that the movie had a bit of campiness.-Especially at the end.-The main bad guy died by getting stuck on a missile.-That's what I'm saying.-It poked fun at itself.-Better thrillers usually do."

Thor,Did you like Thor?,"Yes that was a good movie
Loki is crazy
Absolutely
It made me a little sad though
How come
I wanted thor to stay on earth with his new girlfriend
Yes that would have been ideal
It would
I guess it was a little sad"
Why,Why does every action movie have to have some boring female character?,"So that women will go see the movie.-I don't think women want to go see action movies.-They might.-That's why they have a female character.-Predator didn't have a female character and it was awesome.-Wasn't the Predator a girl?-I don't think it was.-I thought it was pregnant or something.-Well, if they want to make the Predator the female lead in all action movies I could live with that.-I'd pay to see the Predator in 50 Shade of Grey."
Well,"What is your favorite kind of action movies
Well that is a hard pick
I mean it should be simple

What,What's your favorite scene in an action movie?,"The opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" has to be my favorite.-I loved that scene.-Tom Hanks and all the other actors did a great job at portraying what the Army really went through when they landed on Normandy that fateful day.-It was extremly realistic.-I heard Steven Speilberg  hired something like 3000 real soliders to act as extras just in that one scene.-Oh wow, I've never heard that before, do you know where the scene was actually filmed?-They were fimed on Ballinesker Beach, which is in Ireland.-That's awesome.-You can't get much better then the actors in that movie.-Vin Diseal, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, etc.-The list goes on and on.-How many Academy Awards did the film win?-It was nominated for 11 but won 5 in total!"
What,What's your favorite action movie?,"I'd have to say Heat
Yea, Robert De Niro was so good
It had the perfect blend of action and character development
It had such good actors and the directors really took it to the next level
It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.-I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.-Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.-It's hard to get such quality action films
There are a few good ones which I will always rewatch."

Robocop,Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?,"Absolutely.-It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America.-Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals.-The commercials were pretty funny as well.-Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX.-That was a good one.-Did you think they made good use of violence?-Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture.-How do you mean?-Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen.-That is an interesting take."
Transformer,Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?,"I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?-yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?-No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed"
Jones,I wonder if they'll make another Indiana Jones.,"After that last flop?!-Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?-Yeah.-That was terrible.-I'd tend to agree.-Anyhow, Hon Solo is dead.-Shut up!-That's Star Wars.-I know.-Ha!-Harrison Ford is getting a little long in the tooth anyway.-Yeah, time to retire the bull whip."
Seven,I just saw the first Magnificent Seven movie.,"The Yul Brynner one?-Yes, 1960.-I remember watching it.-It was based on a Japanese movie.-No kidding.-Which one?-Seven Samurai, directed by Kurosawa.-C

Bill,Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?,"One, for sure.-Why is that?-It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.-Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.-I take it you like the second?-Yes.-Why?-It's less action, but an action movie!-It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.-Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies."
The,"I love these little movies
What ones
The action movies you know their cartoons
oh like the batman cartoon movies

I will look for them when I watch it."
Wick,John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.,"You're not kidding.-Tons of wide shots.-Right.-Yeah.-Great choreography.-And the editing.-The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.-None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.-Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.-It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.-And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great.-The action is very fluid and not chopped up.-It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene."
music,I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?,"Has to be ""Crank"" hands down
No way ""John Wick""  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in ""Crank""  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.-Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene"
Have,Have you seen fast five?,"Yes thats my favorite fast and furious movie
Mone too, i just love the whole movie
Same here

Expendables,The Expendables was an excellent movie.,"Sounds familiar, who's in it?-Sylvestor Stallone and Jason Statham.-Don't remember if I watched that one.-It's from 2010.-They were mercenaries.-Theres so many movies like that.-Yes, but not with those two in it.-True, then I guess I didn't see it.-It's an hour and fourty minutes but it goes so fast.-Lots of action with those two.-Thats why."

Transformers,"Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?","Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen.-Revenge of the Fallen was so bad.-The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.-I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting.-The story line itself was a mess.-I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise.-Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.-That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films.-I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.-I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent.-Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.-I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?-Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest.-John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role.-I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing."

Do,Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?,"Sure, what are we going to see?-I am not sure, lets look and see whats playing?-lets look for action...Oh ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is playing

Hard,I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.,The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.-I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.-Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.-I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.-If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.-I think i remember that movie.-Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.-Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.-Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.-There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.
John,Do you ever watch John Carpenter movies?,"Sometimes.-Ghosts of Mars is one that you should watch.-It is an action movie with a slight horror twist to it.-Sounds good.-Who was in that one?-That had Jason Statham in it.-I like him.-Was it a fairly recent movie?-Yes, it came out in 2001.
Who else was in it?-Of all people Ice Cube was in it."
Hi,Hi.,"Hi.-Do you have a favorite action movie?-Hmm.-Take your time.-I would probably say Hudson Hawk.-The Bruce Willis movie?-Yeah that's the one.-You know, I've never seen it.-It's a great 80's movie."
What,What is your favorite action movie?,"My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.-That's an interesting choice.-How so?-Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.-I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.-That's true, he never killed an innocent person.-Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.-I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.-Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film."
Charles,DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?,"Sure, all the ""Death Wish"" series.-Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.-He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.-The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.-That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.-He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.-Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.-The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.-In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.-That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.-It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!"
Suburban,You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.,"I've never heard of it.-What's it about?-Oh it's great.-Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.-This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.-It is!-But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great.-They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.-Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?-Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.-Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.-It is so worth it though.-The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.-That just sounds despicable."

What,What was the last action movie you saw?,"I think the last one I saw was the matrix.-What did you think of it?-It was pretty good.-The special effects have mostly aged well.-Yeah they were cutting edge at the time.-Absolutely.-They did some interesting and innovative things to get those 360 degree slow motion shots.-Really, what did they do?-Well they had a ton of cameras placed in a circle around the actors and they took frames from the cameras in succession.-Wow that's really interesting.-What did you think of Keanu Reeves?-He fit the part well, though his acting was a bit stiff as usual."
Lethal,We watched two Lethal Weapon movies this weekend.,"A blast from the past.-Yes, comedy and lots of action.-Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were great in those movies.-They were.-Can't picture any other actors being in those movies.-They were so young.-Joe Pesci was funny in the second one.-He was a cooky character.-They should make one in the current day.-They should.-It would still be a good movie."
Die,Which of the Die Hard movies is your favorite?,"I'm going to go ahead and actually pick a somewhat recent one.-Please, not the one in Russia.-Oh, of course not.-That was ridiculous.-Yeah, A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful.-Live Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long
That was pretty good, yeah.-Which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear?-I think that was Die Hard 2.-Timely with the riots.-That was kind of stupid and disturbing but we got to meet Samuel L Jackson!"

Max,I think Mad Max is probably the best action film in a long time.,"It's up there.-It's basically a nonstop car chase.-I was a bit disappointed that it didn't win more Oscars.-It's kind of tough for a film like that to win outside of some technical categories.-But it was very deserving.-Great performances, great direction...-But it's not really the type of movie to convince the academy.-Do they have any plans for a sequel?-Not that I've heard.-Might be a few years if it did happen.-I'll be first in line when it's released if it's released.-I'll be right there with you."
Pirates,Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet?,"Not yet.-I heard it was just okay.-That's pretty accurate.-The plot was better than some other movies.-That's what I hate about some of these movies.-They can be an incoherent mess.-This one is much simpler.-How was Johnny Depp in this one?-It was kind of weird.-He wasn't a focus as much as I thought he would be.-He is getting old, 50-something by now.-I'm not so sure they'll be another movie in the franchise.-They've milked this thing.-If there's cash to be made, expect another one."

What,What's a good action movie to watch?,"I just saw London Has Fallen.-I thought it was really good.-I saw Olympus Has Fallen and I liked that a lot.-Is London Has Fallen similar?-I actually thought it was better than the first one.-Is Gerard Butler back in it?-He is and he's tough as nails.-Why did you think it was better than the first?-I just thought the premise of London Has Fallen was a bit more believable.-Yeah, some parts of Olympus Has Fallen seemed a bit far fetched.-Exactly.-This one seemed much more plausible."

What,What would you consider an iconic action movie or series?,"I have really enjoyed the Die Hard series.-They weren't all stellar, but when they hit, they were really enjoyable.-The first one was such a classic.-I didn't watch Bruce Willlis much on that TV show he did, but I really thought he made a great transition to films with Die Hard.-I loved how the filmmakers weren't afraid to blow a ton of shit up, and they ended up basically destroying the entire bulding by the end.-I've watched the film many times, and it's amazing how beat up John gets over the course of the film, but he keeps on fighting, and he's really believable.-I agree with you there.-John was a really credible, realistic hero, and you could feel his pain and frustration and determination to get the bad guy.-And what a great bad guy!-I love that he was urbane and witty and cultured and in the end, all he wanted was a shitload of money.-That movie really stands the test of time, too.-The fight sequences were epic.-Guns, fights, lots of action, the hero reuniting with his estranged wife, the cop sidekick, the wisecracking FBI guys.-A great movie all around.-I think Bruce Willis really eanred his rep as an action hero in this and subsequent movies."

The,"Were you a big fan of The Matrix
I liked the first one, but the other ones were pretty bad
Yeah, the first one was really new and fresh
Had a lot of cool special effects
Not sure if I ever followed the actual story line

Too sci fi for my taste",

What,What's the best action movie ever made?,"Die hard without a doubt.-Why die hard?-I mean I enjoy it, but best of all time?-John McClane is such a great action character and Bruce Willis is great in the role.-I'll give you that, but better than some of Jackie Chan's early stuff?-Better than The Terminator?-It's absolutely better than both, don't get me wrong I love Arnold's classic Terminator role as much as the next guy.-I would take any of The Terminator films over any of The Die Hard Films.-Even the one that didn't include Arnold Schwarzenegger in the cast at all?-Absolutely, Die Hard just never really did it for me in a major way.-You're missing out, John McClane would totally terminate the Terminator"

Jackson is in the house with those small time drug dealers.-""Mmhmm!-This IS a tasty burger!""-I will never forget that so long as I live!-That scene is full of amazing dialogue.-How about, ""I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet.""-And the guy goes, ""Which one is it?""-Oh, yes!-And he says, ""It's the one that says 'Bad Mother' beep!"""
Who,"Man this director is nuts

He is one of the best directors out there for action",
Collide,I just watched the movie Collide the other night.,"That's the one with Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones right?-Yeah I've become a huge fan of Nicholas since his role as the War Boy in Mad Max Fury Road.-I'm also a huge fan of Felicity Jones since Like Crazy and recently Rogue One.-Is this an action movie or a romance?-It's starts as a romance but it's a pure action movie.-I was surprised when I found out Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were also in this!-Wait, I didn't know Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were in this!-Ben Kingsley is hilarious in his role.-He plays a slimy criminal that makes Nicholas run errands for him.-He's basically playing a character very similar to his role in Iron Man 3 as the Mandarin.-I've always seen Ben Kingsley as a serious actor but when I watched Ironman 3 that was so surprising in a good way to see that he could really ham it up.-He really hams it up in Collide.-The movie overall was very average, the action was good, the romance bare, and the story plot pretty basic.-I would consider this movie a pretty generic action flick.-This sounds like one of those rainy Sunday afternoon movies to throw on.-I think I'll save it for that occasion."
Christmas,"My favorite Christmas movie of all times is ""Die Hard.""","""Die Hard"" isn't a Christmas movie, it's an action-adventure movie.-It takes place at Christmas.-That makes it a Christmas movie.-Fine.-Name me one other Christmas movie with guns and explosions in it.-If you can do that, I'll admit ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie.-That's too easy.-""Home Alone.""-I bet you think of that as a Christmas movie, don't you?-""Home Alone"" is a movie aimed at the entire family.-Yes, It's got some action-adventure in it but it's for the entire family.-And I think ""Die Hard"" is a great movie for the entire family.-I think you have a bias against Action-Adventure movies.-Don't you want your children to be able to recognize a European scum terrorist/thief?-Honestly, no, that isn't one of my biggest concerns.-I love action-adventure movies.-I love ""Die Hard.""-But ""Die Hard"" is Not a Christmas movie.-It Takes place at Christmas.-That makes it a Christmas movie.-You're weird!"
What,What is your favorite action movie?,"Dark Knight, without a doubt!-That was a pretty good flick.-Heath Ledger played the best Joker ever!-Yeah, but Batman was a little lacking.-It's that stupid voice he puts on.-He does a great Wayne though.-True.-He plays a playboy to the hilt.-And alfred is just wonderful.-You can't really top Micheal Caine."
Hey,"Hey, do you like the marvel movies?","Those are great action movies!-Can't wait for the new Thor one.-Black Panther is going to be great too, I hope that one does really well.-I hope it does as least as great as Wonderwoman, you know.-Really break some records out there.-Wonderwoman was amazing!-It really was directed well with plenty of great action near the end.-Reminds me of the feeling of Guardians of the Galaxy, really.-That sense of loss then pulling out the win at the end.-Both did have that punch moment, true.-It has the whole drawing you in and making you really feel.-Speaking of action movies, Pacific Rim was another great one.-I didn't like that one as much, but the concept was truly unique.-Come on, giant robots?-What's not to like?"
What,What kind of movies do you like?,"I like action

James,Did you see James Cameron may be redoing RoboCop?,"No theres no way that can be true.-The movie was not that bad.-Yeah but I dont think he wants to go down that road
He usually does write novel type of movies.-Yeah I loved RoboCop too

Terminator,Have you ever seen the original Terminator film?,"Of course!-It's one of the best action movies of all time.-Really?-Would you say it's the best of the Terminator movies?-It is my personal favorite.-What about Judgement Day?-Everyone says that one is better.-It has better special effects and action sequences but doesn't have the charm of the original.-How do you mean?-The low budget, sci-fi setting was a lot more appealing to me than the more polished Judgement Day.-I see.-I thought the first one was a little bit campy.-That's part of the charm!"
The,Did you see The Road to Perdition?,"Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised
I know he was amazing in the movie
The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.-My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning ""I am glad it was you""
Talk about chills what a moment
The end was so surprising too you thought Tom Hanks and his son were in the clear than bang the hitman shoots Tom Hanks in front of his son Michael.-The whole movie just blew me away.-I can watch it over and over"
Bond,What was your favorite Bond movie?,"Old or new?-There's been so many.-I would just say ones that have been made recently, like the last 15 years or so.-So out of the Daniel Craig movies?-Skyfall.-See, I always thought that was a bit overrated.-I prefer Casino Royale.-Well, that was the first one with him I think.-They worked the kinks out in that movie.-I actually thought the plot was better than Skyfall.-We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.-One thing's for sure: Quantam of Solace was garbage.-Oh yeah.-Not a good film."
John,"Did you get a chance to see John Wick, Chapter 2?","Yea, but I didn't really like it.-Oh, that's too bad.-Why not?-Well, it just wasn't as cool as the first one.-I thought it was better than the first.-It had way more assasins in it.-Yea that's true, and that fight scene with Keanu Reeves and Common was pretty good.-Yea!-That was awesome.-I guess it wasn't so bad afterall.-Yea, and the next one looks like it will be even better.-That's true, the next could be pretty good."

Point,"What did you think of the remake of the movie ""Point Break""?","I wasn't happy at first, just because I think Hollywood needs to chill out with remaking great old movies, but after watching the remake I thought it was pretty good.-I couldn't agree more.-I can't picture Point Break without Keanu Reeves acting at Johnny Utah but the remake followed the orginal storyline pretty well.-The remake had just as much or even more action scenes then the orginial one that was released in 1991.-Can't believe the first one was released in 1991!-It's still a classic movie and one of my favorites.-Kathryn Bigelow did a fanstatic job directing the orginial Point Break, as an audience member, the film really throws you into Johnny Utah's extreme life.-Speaking of extreme, how bout that skydiving scene in the first movie?-I love that scene.-When Johnny Utah jumps out the airplane with no parachute to catch Bodhi?-Yeah man, I doubt that would be possible in real life but it sure looked good on the big screen.-Sometimes I wish I lived a life like Johnny Utah.-I dressed up as one of the dead presidents for halloween a few years ago."
You,I saw Taken on You Tube last night.,"Good movie.-Liam Neeson?-Yes.-Written by Luc Besson.-Who is the director?-Pierre Morel.-Who plays the daughter?-Maggie Grace.-Isn't she being auctioned off?-Yes, but Neeson kills the corrupt Arab in the end.-Is that pc?"

red pill or the blue pill?-i want the truth.-i'll be the chosen one.-I think i agree too.-I wanna look like keanu dodging those bullets
and those fighting skills too
The fights were crazy cool"
True,You remember that True Lies movie?,"From way back when.-1994 I think.-Yeah.-That was a pretty solid movie though.-I remember Jamie Lee Curtis was in it as his wife.-Which seems weird as she doesn't seem like a sex symbol.-She actually looked pretty good in it where she had to wear that dress.Which
I appreciated that the movie had a bit of campiness.-Especially at the end.-The main bad guy died by getting stuck on a missile.-That's what I'm saying.-It poked fun at itself.-Better thrillers usually do."
Bruce,My favorite Bruce Willis movie is Die Hard.,"Man, I loved that movie when I was a kid.-Oh, yeah, I thought he was so tough.-I wanted to be like him.-I don't blame you.-He set a standard.-Alan Rickman was a formidable villain, too.-Yes, I thought they worked well together onscreen.-There were lots of cool sequences in that film.-There sure were.-I think a lot of films copied its style.-I thought it was cool that it was set during Christmas, too.-Me, too.-I watch it every Christmas!"

Have,Have you watched any good action films lately?,"I seen Mad Max, finally.-Better late than never.What did you think?-I loved the fight scenes.-Charlize Theron does a good fight scene.-She was really something to watch.-Her fight scenes were so real.-The whole thing was non stop, like no room to take the film easy.-I thought it could have done with a bit of a slow of pace at times.-Just to catch up after all the fighting?-Yes, and the car chases."
Do,Do you like action movies?,"I do!-I love going to the theatre to see them.-What kind of action movies do you enjoy?-I really love action movies with strong female leads, what about you?-I'm really into dystopian action movies, a lot of them start out as books and are translated onto screen really well.-I love dystopian everything.-Dystopian action films with strong female leads have really blown up in the last few years.-Thats so true.-The entire action genre has really split into so many different categories, its no longer just blowing stuff up.-Yeah, I think it's because you can only blow so much stuff up before it gets boring for the viewers.-There's definitely some classics that are mostly just blowing things up that I still enjoy though.-I agree, you can't beat a classic."
Last,I thought that The Last Boy Scout was an underrated action flick.,"I did too.-Bruce Willis used to be a good actor.-He and Damon Wayans played well off of each other in that movie.-Willis played a private eye down on his luck and Wayans was the Pro Football player.-Yeah, I could go back and watch that one again.-Do you remember who directed that movie?-That was a Tony Scott film.-I didn't realize that he directed that one.-Yeah, he did.-He is one of my favorite directors."

Thor,Did you like Thor?,"Yes that was a good movie
Loki is crazy
Absolutely
It made me a little sad though
How come
I wanted thor to stay on earth with his new girlfriend
Yes that would have been ideal
It would
I guess it was a little sad"
Why,Why does every action movie have to have some boring female character?,"So that women will go see the movie.-I don't think women want to go see action movies.-They might.-That's why they have a female character.-Predator didn't have a female character and it was awesome.-Wasn't the Predator a girl?-I don't think it was.-I thought it was pregnant or something.-Well, if they want to make the Predator the female lead in all action movies I could live with that.-I'd pay to see the Predator in 50 Shade of Grey."
Well,"What is your favorite kind of action movies
Well that is a hard pick
I mean it should be simple
Nah it is not
Well i love ones like kung fu films
Those are pretty neat
You like them?","Yeah they are fun
I like the old ones the best
some new ones are good too"
Edge,Did you see Edge of Tomorrow?,"What is that?-It's Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt dying every day to learn how to defeat aliens who can reset time.-That's what it's called?-Yeah.-I saw it but not that name.-What was it?-Live.-Die.-Repeat.-Oooh, they renamed it because the studio thought we couldn't handle the title.-Seriously?-It's not that hard to figure out."
What,What's your favorite scene in an action movie?,"The opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" has to be my favorite.-I loved that scene.-Tom Hanks and all the other actors did a great job at portraying what the Army really went through when they landed on Normandy that fateful day.-It was extremly realistic.-I heard Steven Speilberg  hired something like 3000 real soliders to act as extras just in that one scene.-Oh wow, I've never heard that before, do you know where the scene was actually filmed?-They were fimed on Ballinesker Beach, which is in Ireland.-That's awesome.-You can't get much better then the actors in that movie.-Vin Diseal, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, etc.-The list goes on and on.-How many Academy Awards did the film win?-It was nominated for 11 but won 5 in total!"
What,What's your favorite action movie?,"I'd have to say Heat
Yea, Robert De Niro was so good
It had the perfect blend of action and character development
It had such good actors and the directors really took it to the next level
It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.-I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.-Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.-It's hard to get such quality action films
There are a few good ones which I will always rewatch."
The,Did you see The Great Wall?,"No, it looked pretty cheesy to me.-It was ok.-Some of the action scenes were cool.-I couldn't believe Matt Damon was in it.-I like his movies ususally.-Did you see all of the Bourne movies?-Yeah, those are some of my favorite action movies.-I really didn't like the Bourne Legacy though.-No, me either.-Bourne has got to be Matt Damon for sure.-Jeremy Renner isn't bad really though.-I liked him in The Hurt Locker.-I think he did good playing Hawkeye in the Avengers movies."

Snakes,One of my favorite movies is Snakes on a Plane.,"With Samuel Jackson, right?-Yes.-I saw that a while ago.-He just has so many great lines in that.-He does.-But he's good in every movie he's in.-Amazing how an entire movie can take place in a plane.-Yeah, and it kept you interested too.-It sure did.-So much going on all the time.-That is high on my list too."
Over,"Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad",
French,I just saw The French Connection.,"Number 1 or 2?-Number 1.-Gene Hackman is great in that.-Roy Scheider wasn't bad, either.-Who was the French crime lord?-Fernando Rey, in a distinguished performance.-Neat.-I forget the director.-William Friedkin.-Wow, who can forget The Exorcist?"
Robocop,Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?,"Absolutely.-It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America.-Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals.-The commercials were pretty funny as well.-Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX.-That was a good one.-Did you think they made good use of violence?-Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture.-How do you mean?-Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen.-That is an interesting take."
Transformer,Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?,"I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?-yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?-No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed"
Jones,I wonder if they'll make another Indiana Jones.,"After that last flop?!-Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?-Yeah.-That was terrible.-I'd tend to agree.-Anyhow, Hon Solo is dead.-Shut up!-That's Star Wars.-I know.-Ha!-Harrison Ford is getting a little long in the tooth anyway.-Yeah, time to retire the bull whip."
Seven,I just saw the first Magnificent Seven movie.,"The Yul Brynner one?-Yes, 1960.-I remember watching it.-It was based on a Japanese movie.-No kidding.-Which one?-Seven Samurai, directed by Kurosawa.-C
I didn't know that!-Yes, with Toshiro Mifune.-He is a cool actor."
Jason,How'd you like Jason Bourne?,"It was OK.-I thought it was great!-The first one was better.-Oh, yeah.-Clive Owen was in that one.-He's really good.-Too bad they had to kill him off in the first one.-It was either him or Bourne.-True enough.-But they've had plenty of good antogonists."
Mad,Did you see the new Mad Max movie.,"Yes, loved it!-yeah, I thought it was good as well.-Charlize Theron was great.-I also liked Tom Hardy.-I heard they used some of the original cast from the first one
Which one?-The bad guy from the original Road Warrior from back in the late 70s
Really?-I had no idea
Yeah, I read something about it.-Very interesting."
Die,What is your favorite Die Hard movie?,"That's some tough competition.-They are all good.-For me, I'll say the second one.-The one in the airport?-Yep.-A lot more was on the line since they could crash planes.-That's a fair argument.-The first will always be the best though.-That's true with most movies.-Best villain by far though with Hans.-No argument there.-That was a classic.-RIP Alan Rickman."
Bill,Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?,"One, for sure.-Why is that?-It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.-Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.-I take it you like the second?-Yes.-Why?-It's less action, but an action movie!-It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.-Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies."
The,"I love these little movies
What ones
The action movies you know their cartoons
oh like the batman cartoon movies
Yeah the action is very well scripted and done really well
I do think they are pretty good

Most cartoon action movies are meh
Yeah but the batman ones are amazing
Yep most definitely",
The,Have you ever seen The Running Man?,"Yes, that is with Arnold Shwarzenegger right?-Yes, he is in that one.-He is in tons of action movies.-Ever seen Total Recall?-Of course.-He is good in that one too.-I liked him in Conan the Barbarian a lot.-Oh yeah and Conan the Destroyer.-Did you like him in Terminator 3?-Yes, but I liked him way better in part 1 and 2."
Max,I just watched Mad Max Fury road.,"How was it?-Well, it was non stop action from beginning to end.-Sounds like a good movie.-Yes it was.-Then I wanted to watch the original so i did.-Mel Gibson looked really young.-He was in the first ones.-The same director who directed road warrior directed Fury Road.-Were the styles similar?-Oh yes, and there were lots of easter eggs
I will look for them when I watch it."
Wick,John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.,"You're not kidding.-Tons of wide shots.-Right.-Yeah.-Great choreography.-And the editing.-The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.-None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.-Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.-It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.-And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great.-The action is very fluid and not chopped up.-It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene."
music,I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?,"Has to be ""Crank"" hands down
No way ""John Wick""  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in ""Crank""  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.-Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene"
Have,Have you seen fast five?,"Yes thats my favorite fast and furious movie
Mone too, i just love the whole movie
Same here
Its the most interesting one
Exactly, i love the ending
It was so unexpected
I couldnt believe how they traded those safes like that

Fiction,I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time today.,"Wow, that is a real classic cult action film.-It was nothing like what I expected.-John Travolta is brilliant in that movie.-He was like this cool contract killer, him and the other guy?-Samuel L. Jackson?-Yes!-When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense.-Then ended up shooting the guy any way.-Yes!-I liked how all the stories bled into one another.-Yes, but some characters never even met.-Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,"
Con,Did you ever see Con Air?,Probalby my favorite Nicholas Cage film.-That movie had everyone!-Even Dave Chapelle.-He was so funny!-Who played the main villian?-Cyrus?-Yeah.-John Malcovich.-That right!

What,What's your favorite action movie that is based on a television show?,"That would be The Fugitive.-Is that the Harrisson Ford film from the 90s?-Yep, that's the one.-That is a great film and I especially enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's character.-I agree, he was fantastic.-Did you know that he improvised the line, ""I don't care!""?-I think I had heard that before.-It's a great line.-Let's not forget about Harrisson Ford either.-He was excellent as well.-I think he was good, but not great."
Patrick,Did you like any of Patrick Swayzes action films?,"Like Ghost?-No, that is a romance.-I mean like Point Break.-With Keanu Reeves?-That one.-I think it was a cool like surfer action one.-I liked that the bad guys were all sporty.-They were not that bad of bad guys too.-The people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them.-I think that was just good acting on their parts."
Tag,Question,Responses
Bourne,I love the Jason Bourne franchise.,"Yeah, me too.-Matt Damon really turned the spy genre upside down with that one.-How so?-He created a spy that had human flaws and wasn't perfect.-I can see how that is true.-The first one in the series is my favorite.-Mine too.-We really get to know Matt Damon's character for the first time.-I agree and the action sequences were remarkable."
Terminator,Can't believe Terminator 2 came out 25 years ago.,"It's crazy, isn't it?-Still one of the better action movies I've ever seen.-The whole Terminator series was awesome, but T2 brought it to a whole another level.-Arnold was a complete boss in that movie.-He was overwhelmed.-The T1000 was the superior machine.-Yeah, but the T800 is no slouch.-Plus he looks like Arnold.-The rest of the series got pretty bad though.-Yeah, once James Cameron left the director's chair, it ran off the rails.-Think he'll ever get back in it?-I doubt it.-Doesn't change the fact they were great movies."
Expendables,The Expendables was an excellent movie.,"Sounds familiar, who's in it?-Sylvestor Stallone and Jason Statham.-Don't remember if I watched that one.-It's from 2010.-They were mercenaries.-Theres so many movies like that.-Yes, but not with those two in it.-True, then I guess I didn't see it.-It's an hour and fourty minutes but it goes so fast.-Lots of action with those two.-Thats why."
Face,Did you ever see Face Off?,"One of my favorites!-I know!-It was so good!-I think what was most compelling is Cage and Travolta trading off.-Yeah, they both get to play the good and bad guy.-Very cool.-And the action was super intense.-I didn't care much for the ""procedure"".-Yeah, that was a bit gross.-I'm shuddering just thinking about it!"
Cyborg,What do you think about Cyborg?,"I thought it was a terrific action flick
Did Jean-Claude Van Damme ever have a bad movie?-Never.-They were all some of the best action movies ever.-Did you like Bloodsport?-Yes, it was fantastic.-He was great in that one.-When did that one come out?-In 1988
Who directed it?-Newt Arnold."

music,transformers is a crap series!,"why, i like it
its crap because they do not have consistent main characters
isn't thats what makes a good movie?-the plot is pretty much the same
that is true.-they just keep fighting megatron, who just doesn't die.-that does get annoying now that you mention it.-and now on the new movie.-optimus is killing bumblebee

Transformers,"Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?","Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen.-Revenge of the Fallen was so bad.-The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.-I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting.-The story line itself was a mess.-I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise.-Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.-That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films.-I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.-I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent.-Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.-I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?-Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest.-John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role.-I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing."
Transformers,Have you heard of the new Transformers movie that's coming out?,"No I haven't, what is the name of it?-It's Transformers: The Last Knight and is directed by Michael Bay.-Awesome, I hope this one lives up to the hype from the rest of them.-Me too, the last couple of movies that Michael Bay put out have been hit or miss.-Ya but they action in them have still been good.-I have high expectations for this movie.-Why is that?-The last one that came out was a disappointment for me.-I think that Mark Wahlberg will do another good job of acting in this movie.-Michael Bay does make good movies at times.-You're right, I will go into this movie with an open mind and hopefully the movie turns out good.-Awesome!-I look forward to seeing it with you when it comes out."
Do,Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?,"Sure, what are we going to see?-I am not sure, lets look and see whats playing?-lets look for action...Oh ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is playing
ok, if you want action, that is the right choice
I hear optimus prime is the bad guy in this
no way, how does that happen I wonder
I dont know, we will see this weekend
I cant wait
me either, I love a good action film"
Hard,I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.,The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.-I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.-Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.-I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.-If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.-I think i remember that movie.-Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.-Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.-Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.-There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.
John,Do you ever watch John Carpenter movies?,"Sometimes.-Ghosts of Mars is one that you should watch.-It is an action movie with a slight horror twist to it.-Sounds good.-Who was in that one?-That had Jason Statham in it.-I like him.-Was it a fairly recent movie?-Yes, it came out in 2001.
Who else was in it?-Of all people Ice Cube was in it."
Hi,Hi.,"Hi.-Do you have a favorite action movie?-Hmm.-Take your time.-I would probably say Hudson Hawk.-The Bruce Willis movie?-Yeah that's the one.-You know, I've never seen it.-It's a great 80's movie."
What,What is your favorite action movie?,"My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.-That's an interesting choice.-How so?-Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.-I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.-That's true, he never killed an innocent person.-Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.-I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.-Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film."
Charles,DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?,"Sure, all the ""Death Wish"" series.-Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.-He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.-The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.-That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.-He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.-Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.-The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.-In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.-That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.-It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!"
Suburban,You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.,"I've never heard of it.-What's it about?-Oh it's great.-Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.-This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.-It is!-But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great.-They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.-Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?-Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.-Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.-It is so worth it though.-The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.-That just sounds despicable."
Have,Have you seen the movie kingsmen?,"Yes it was a great movie
I love spy movies
Me too
And this one had lots of action and suspense
I just found out they are coming out with a new one this year
Thats awesome, when?-I read in september
I cant wait
Me either"
Day,I watched Patriot's Day this weekend.,"I didn't think it showed enough action.-Really?-I thought it was just enough.-Yes there wasn't much in the way of chases.-Well, it's based on a true story so they couldn't deviate from that much.-I understand.-I was a good movie though other than that.-I thought that it made you really reflect on these people as actual people.-Yes sometimes in movies it's hard to separate fact and fiction.-This was really someones life.-Yes and they did a great job honoring them."

Right, when you strip out all the action and effects, the story line is pretty lame
Something about red and blue pills
Well there's that and how the world isn't what it seems
Yeah, pretty weird
Too sci fi for my taste",

Matrix,What did you think of the final Matrix movie?,"Revolutions?-Yup, that one.-It was too preachy.-I think it would have been fine if they didn't rush it.-What do you mean?-Remember, parts 2 and 3 came out in May and November of the same year?-That explains the crap CGI.-The script, too, it was awful.-Could have been less obvious with the Jesus reference, too."
What,What's the best action movie ever made?,"Die hard without a doubt.-Why die hard?-I mean I enjoy it, but best of all time?-John McClane is such a great action character and Bruce Willis is great in the role.-I'll give you that, but better than some of Jackie Chan's early stuff?-Better than The Terminator?-It's absolutely better than both, don't get me wrong I love Arnold's classic Terminator role as much as the next guy.-I would take any of The Terminator films over any of The Die Hard Films.-Even the one that didn't include Arnold Schwarzenegger in the cast at all?-Absolutely, Die Hard just never really did it for me in a major way.-You're missing out, John McClane would totally terminate the Terminator"

What,What action movies do you recommend me to see this summer?,"Personally I'd recommend Wonder Woman.-I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to that movie.-I really feel it's over hyped because it's a chick.-Honestly the movie is good, I won't lie to you it does a bit of the whole ""girl power"" crap but not so much where you get turned off.-So what is the movie about?-Origin story or something else?-Yup it's basically just like the comics.-Set in world war 2, meets that stranded pilot,etc.-You know how the story goes.-So she helps end world war 2?-Yeah, well she basically ends it herself, but the guys help too.-Seriously?-If it's overdone just let me know now so I don't waste my time.-No it's very enjoyable.-You won't even think about all the girl power junk in it if you are a fan of the comic and character."

Christmas,"My favorite Christmas movie of all times is ""Die Hard.""","""Die Hard"" isn't a Christmas movie, it's an action-adventure movie.-It takes place at Christmas.-That makes it a Christmas movie.-Fine.-Name me one other Christmas movie with guns and explosions in it.-If you can do that, I'll admit ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie.-That's too easy.-""Home Alone.""-I bet you think of that as a Christmas movie, don't you?-""Home Alone"" is a movie aimed at the entire family.-Yes, It's got some action-adventure in it but it's for the entire family.-And I think ""Die Hard"" is a great movie for the entire family.-I think you have a bias against Action-Adventure movies.-Don't you want your children to be able to recognize a European scum terrorist/thief?-Honestly, no, that isn't one of my biggest concerns.-I love action-adventure movies.-I love ""Die Hard.""-But ""Die Hard"" is Not a Christmas movie.-It Takes place at Christmas.-That makes it a Christmas movie.-You're weird!"

James,Did you see James Cameron may be redoing RoboCop?,"No theres no way that can be true.-The movie was not that bad.-Yeah but I dont think he wants to go down that road
He usually does write novel type of movies.-Yeah I loved RoboCop too

The,Did you see The Road to Perdition?,"Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised

The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.-My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning ""I am glad it was you""

What,What's your favorite scene in an action movie?,"The opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" has to be my favorite.-I loved that scene.-Tom Hanks and all the other actors did a great job at portraying what the Army really went through when they landed on Normandy that fateful day.-It was extremly realistic.-I heard Steven Speilberg  hired something like 3000 real soliders to act as extras just in that one scene.-Oh wow, I've never heard that before, do you know where the scene was actually filmed?-They were fimed on Ballinesker Beach, which is in Ireland.-That's awesome.-You can't get much better then the actors in that movie.-Vin Diseal, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, etc.-The list goes on and on.-How many Academy Awards did the film win?-It was nominated for 11 but won 5 in total!"
What,What's your favorite action movie?,"I'd have to say Heat
Yea, Robert De Niro was so good
It had the perfect blend of action and character development
It had such good actors and the directors really took it to the next level
It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.-I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.-Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.-It's hard to get such quality action films
There are a few good ones which I will always rewatch."
The,Did you see The Great Wall?,"No, it looked pretty cheesy to me.-It was ok.-Some of the action scenes were cool.-I couldn't believe Matt Damon was in it.-I like his movies ususally.-Did you see all of the Bourne movies?-Yeah, those are some of my favorite action movies.-I really didn't like the Bourne Legacy though.-No, me either.-Bourne has got to be Matt Damon for sure.-Jeremy Renner isn't bad really though.-I liked him in The Hurt Locker.-I think he did good playing Hawkeye in the Avengers movies."
Kong,Did you see Kong: Skull Island yet?,"Yes I have.-What did you think of it?-I thought it was amazing actually, you?-Me too, I really liked how they incorporated the giant animals on the island, that was really cool.-I agree, watching Kong fight with giant monsters was my favorite part.-Do you think they will make a sequel?-I sure hope so, John Goodman and Samuel L Jackson did such a good job in that movie?-Didn't they both die in it though?-I think so."
Snakes,One of my favorite movies is Snakes on a Plane.,"With Samuel Jackson, right?-Yes.-I saw that a while ago.-He just has so many great lines in that.-He does.-But he's good in every movie he's in.-Amazing how an entire movie can take place in a plane.-Yeah, and it kept you interested too.-It sure did.-So much going on all the time.-That is high on my list too."
Over,"Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad",
French,I just saw The French Connection.,"Number 1 or 2?-Number 1.-Gene Hackman is great in that.-Roy Scheider wasn't bad, either.-Who was the French crime lord?-Fernando Rey, in a distinguished performance.-Neat.-I forget the director.-William Friedkin.-Wow, who can forget The Exorcist?"
Robocop,Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?,"Absolutely.-It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America.-Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals.-The commercials were pretty funny as well.-Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX.-That was a good one.-Did you think they made good use of violence?-Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture.-How do you mean?-Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen.-That is an interesting take."
Transformer,Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?,"I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?-yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?-No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed"
Jones,I wonder if they'll make another Indiana Jones.,"After that last flop?!-Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?-Yeah.-That was terrible.-I'd tend to agree.-Anyhow, Hon Solo is dead.-Shut up!-That's Star Wars.-I know.-Ha!-Harrison Ford is getting a little long in the tooth anyway.-Yeah, time to retire the bull whip."
Seven,I just saw the first Magnificent Seven movie.,"The Yul Brynner one?-Yes, 1960.-I remember watching it.-It was based on a Japanese movie.-No kidding.-Which one?-Seven Samurai, directed by Kurosawa.-C
I didn't know that!-Yes, with Toshiro Mifune.-He is a cool actor."
Jason,How'd you like Jason Bourne?,"It was OK.-I thought it was great!-The first one was better.-Oh, yeah.-Clive Owen was in that one.-He's really good.-Too bad they had to kill him off in the first one.-It was either him or Bourne.-True enough.-But they've had plenty of good antogonists."
Mad,Did you see the new Mad Max movie.,"Yes, loved it!-yeah, I thought it was good as well.-Charlize Theron was great.-I also liked Tom Hardy.-I heard they used some of the original cast from the first one
Which one?-The bad guy from the original Road Warrior from back in the late 70s
Really?-I had no idea
Yeah, I read something about it.-Very interesting."
Die,What is your favorite Die Hard movie?,"That's some tough competition.-They are all good.-For me, I'll say the second one.-The one in the airport?-Yep.-A lot more was on the line since they could crash planes.-That's a fair argument.-The first will always be the best though.-That's true with most movies.-Best villain by far though with Hans.-No argument there.-That was a classic.-RIP Alan Rickman."
Bill,Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?,"One, for sure.-Why is that?-It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.-Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.-I take it you like the second?-Yes.-Why?-It's less action, but an action movie!-It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.-Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies."
The,"I love these little movies
What ones
The action movies you know their cartoons
oh like the batman cartoon movies
Yeah the action is very well scripted and done really well
I do think they are pretty good

Most cartoon action movies are meh
Yeah but the batman ones are amazing
Yep most definitely",
The,Have you ever seen The Running Man?,"Yes, that is with Arnold Shwarzenegger right?-Yes, he is in that one.-He is in tons of action movies.-Ever seen Total Recall?-Of course.-He is good in that one too.-I liked him in Conan the Barbarian a lot.-Oh yeah and Conan the Destroyer.-Did you like him in Terminator 3?-Yes, but I liked him way better in part 1 and 2."
Max,I just watched Mad Max Fury road.,"How was it?-Well, it was non stop action from beginning to end.-Sounds like a good movie.-Yes it was.-Then I wanted to watch the original so i did.-Mel Gibson looked really young.-He was in the first ones.-The same director who directed road warrior directed Fury Road.-Were the styles similar?-Oh yes, and there were lots of easter eggs
I will look for them when I watch it."
Wick,John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.,"You're not kidding.-Tons of wide shots.-Right.-Yeah.-Great choreography.-And the editing.-The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.-None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.-Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.-It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.-And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great.-The action is very fluid and not chopped up.-It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene."
music,I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?,"Has to be ""Crank"" hands down
No way ""John Wick""  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in ""Crank""  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.-Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene"
Have,Have you seen fast five?,"Yes thats my favorite fast and furious movie
Mone too, i just love the whole movie
Same here

Jackson?-Yes!-When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense.-Then ended up shooting the guy any way.-Yes!-I liked how all the stories bled into one another.-Yes, but some characters never even met.-Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,"

What,What's your favorite action movie that is based on a television show?,"That would be The Fugitive.-Is that the Harrisson Ford film from the 90s?-Yep, that's the one.-That is a great film and I especially enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's character.-I agree, he was fantastic.-Did you know that he improvised the line, ""I don't care!""?-I think I had heard that before.-It's a great line.-Let's not forget about Harrisson Ford either.-He was excellent as well.-I think he was good, but not great."
Patrick,Did you like any of Patrick Swayzes action films?,"Like Ghost?-No, that is a romance.-I mean like Point Break.-With Keanu Reeves?-That one.-I think it was a cool like surfer action one.-I liked that the bad guys were all sporty.-They were not that bad of bad guys too.-The people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them.-I think that was just good acting on their parts."
Tag,Question,Responses

Terminator,Can't believe Terminator 2 came out 25 years ago.,"It's crazy, isn't it?-Still one of the better action movies I've ever seen.-The whole Terminator series was awesome, but T2 brought it to a whole another level.-Arnold was a complete boss in that movie.-He was overwhelmed.-The T1000 was the superior machine.-Yeah, but the T800 is no slouch.-Plus he looks like Arnold.-The rest of the series got pretty bad though.-Yeah, once James Cameron left the director's chair, it ran off the rails.-Think he'll ever get back in it?-I doubt it.-Doesn't change the fact they were great movies."
Expendables,The Expendables was an excellent movie.,"Sounds familiar, who's in it?-Sylvestor Stallone and Jason Statham.-Don't remember if I watched that one.-It's from 2010.-They were mercenaries.-Theres so many movies like that.-Yes, but not with those two in it.-True, then I guess I didn't see it.-It's an hour and fourty minutes but it goes so fast.-Lots of action with those two.-Thats why."
Face,Did you ever see Face Off?,"One of my favorites!-I know!-It was so good!-I think what was most compelling is Cage and Travolta trading off.-Yeah, they both get to play the good and bad guy.-Very cool.-And the action was super intense.-I didn't care much for the ""procedure"".-Yeah, that was a bit gross.-I'm shuddering just thinking about it!"
Cyborg,What do you think about Cyborg?,"I thought it was a terrific action flick
Did Jean-Claude Van Damme ever have a bad movie?-Never.-They were all some of the best action movies ever.-Did you like Bloodsport?-Yes, it was fantastic.-He was great in that one.-When did that one come out?-In 1988

music,transformers is a crap series!,"why, i like it
its crap because they do not have consistent main characters
isn't thats what makes a good movie?-the plot is pretty much the same

Transformers,"Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?","Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen.-Revenge of the Fallen was so bad.-The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.-I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting.-The story line itself was a mess.-I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise.-Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.-That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films.-I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.-I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent.-Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.-I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?-Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest.-John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role.-I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing."

Do,Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?,"Sure, what are we going to see?-I am not sure, lets look and see whats playing?-lets look for action...Oh ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" is playing
ok, if you want action, that is the right choice
I hear optimus prime is the bad guy in this
no way, how does that happen I wonder
I dont know, we will see this weekend
I cant wait
me either, I love a good action film"
Hard,I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.,The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.-I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.-Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.-I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.-If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.-I think i remember that movie.-Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.-Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.-Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.-There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.
John,Do you ever watch John Carpenter movies?,"Sometimes.-Ghosts of Mars is one that you should watch.-It is an action movie with a slight horror twist to it.-Sounds good.-Who was in that one?-That had Jason Statham in it.-I like him.-Was it a fairly recent movie?-Yes, it came out in 2001.
Who else was in it?-Of all people Ice Cube was in it."
Hi,Hi.,"Hi.-Do you have a favorite action movie?-Hmm.-Take your time.-I would probably say Hudson Hawk.-The Bruce Willis movie?-Yeah that's the one.-You know, I've never seen it.-It's a great 80's movie."
What,What is your favorite action movie?,"My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.-That's an interesting choice.-How so?-Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.-I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.-That's true, he never killed an innocent person.-Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.-I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.-Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film."
Charles,DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?,"Sure, all the ""Death Wish"" series.-Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.-He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.-The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.-That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.-He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.-Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.-The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.-In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.-That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.-It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!"
Suburban,You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.,"I've never heard of it.-What's it about?-Oh it's great.-Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.-This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.-It is!-But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great.-They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.-Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?-Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.-Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.-It is so worth it though.-The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.-That just sounds despicable."
Have,Have you seen the movie kingsmen?,"Yes it was a great movie
I love spy movies
Me too
And this one had lots of action and suspense
I just found out they are coming out with a new one this year

Day,I watched Patriot's Day this weekend.,"I didn't think it showed enough action.-Really?-I thought it was just enough.-Yes there wasn't much in the way of chases.-Well, it's based on a true story so they couldn't deviate from that much.-I understand.-I was a good movie though other than that.-I thought that it made you really reflect on these people as actual people.-Yes sometimes in movies it's hard to separate fact and fiction.-This was really someones life.-Yes and they did a great job honoring them."
What,What was the last action movie you saw?,"I think the last one I saw was the matrix.-What did you think of it?-It was pretty good.-The special effects have mostly aged well.-Yeah they were cutting edge at the time.-Absolutely.-They did some interesting and innovative things to get those 360 degree slow motion shots.-Really, what did they do?-Well they had a ton of cameras placed in a circle around the actors and they took frames from the cameras in succession.-Wow that's really interesting.-What did you think of Keanu Reeves?-He fit the part well, though his acting was a bit stiff as usual."
Lethal,We watched two Lethal Weapon movies this weekend.,"A blast from the past.-Yes, comedy and lots of action.-Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were great in those movies.-They were.-Can't picture any other actors being in those movies.-They were so young.-Joe Pesci was funny in the second one.-He was a cooky character.-They should make one in the current day.-They should.-It would still be a good movie."
Die,Which of the Die Hard movies is your favorite?,"I'm going to go ahead and actually pick a somewhat recent one.-Please, not the one in Russia.-Oh, of course not.-That was ridiculous.-Yeah, A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful.-Live Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long
That was pretty good, yeah.-Which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear?-I think that was Die Hard 2.-Timely with the riots.-That was kind of stupid and disturbing but we got to meet Samuel L Jackson!"
Night,I just saw Sleepless Night.,"French movie, I believe.-Yes, directed by Frederic Jardin.-What's it about?-A French detective's son is kidnapped for cocaine.-Who stars in the movie?-Tomer Sisley.-Adel Bencherif
Tomer Sisley is hot!-Yes, he was in Angelique.-Another cool flick."
Do,Do you like action movies?,"I loved Mad Max Fury Road?-Me too.-Whose your favorite character?-Furiosa

Max,I think Mad Max is probably the best action film in a long time.,"It's up there.-It's basically a nonstop car chase.-I was a bit disappointed that it didn't win more Oscars.-It's kind of tough for a film like that to win outside of some technical categories.-But it was very deserving.-Great performances, great direction...-But it's not really the type of movie to convince the academy.-Do they have any plans for a sequel?-Not that I've heard.-Might be a few years if it did happen.-I'll be first in line when it's released if it's released.-I'll be right there with you."

Have,Have you ever seen undisputed 2?,"Yea, with michael jai white!-Yea, that guy is a beast.-Yea, he is so good at martial arts.-There were a lot of good fight scenes in that movie.-The best one was at the end with boyka.-Who is Boyka Played my?-Scott Adkins I think.-That guy is amazing, too.-Yea, the two of them together was an unstoppable combination."
Shoot,"If you want to watch a great movie, watch Shoot 'em Up.","Never heard of it.-Clive Owen is in it.-I like that actor.-Yes, his movies are almost always good.-Who else is in it?-Paul Giamatti.-Let me guess, he's a bad guy, right?-Of course, isn't he almost always?-Yes.-Well I like both of them, so I'll have to rent it."
What,What's a good action movie to watch?,"I just saw London Has Fallen.-I thought it was really good.-I saw Olympus Has Fallen and I liked that a lot.-Is London Has Fallen similar?-I actually thought it was better than the first one.-Is Gerard Butler back in it?-He is and he's tough as nails.-Why did you think it was better than the first?-I just thought the premise of London Has Fallen was a bit more believable.-Yeah, some parts of Olympus Has Fallen seemed a bit far fetched.-Exactly.-This one seemed much more plausible."

James,Did you see James Cameron may be redoing RoboCop?,"No theres no way that can be true.-The movie was not that bad.-Yeah but I dont think he wants to go down that road
He usually does write novel type of movies.-Yeah I loved RoboCop too

The,Did you see The Road to Perdition?,"Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised
I know he was amazing in the movie
The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.-My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning ""I am glad it was you""
Talk about chills what a moment

Yea, Robert De Niro was so good

It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.-I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.-Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.-It's hard to get such quality action films

Transformer,Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?,"I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?-yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?-No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed"
Jones,I wonder if they'll make another Indiana Jones.,"After that last flop?!-Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?-Yeah.-That was terrible.-I'd tend to agree.-Anyhow, Hon Solo is dead.-Shut up!-That's Star Wars.-I know.-Ha!-Harrison Ford is getting a little long in the tooth anyway.-Yeah, time to retire the bull whip."

Bill,Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?,"One, for sure.-Why is that?-It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.-Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.-I take it you like the second?-Yes.-Why?-It's less action, but an action movie!-It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.-Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies."

Wick,John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.,"You're not kidding.-Tons of wide shots.-Right.-Yeah.-Great choreography.-And the editing.-The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.-None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.-Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.-It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.-And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great.-The action is very fluid and not chopped up.-It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene."
music,I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?,"Has to be ""Crank"" hands down
No way ""John Wick""  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in ""Crank""  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.-Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene"
Have,Have you seen fast five?,"Yes thats my favorite fast and furious movie
Mone too, i just love the whole movie
Same here
Its the most interesting one
Exactly, i love the ending
It was so unexpected
I couldnt believe how they traded those safes like that
Me either
It was exciting"
Jurassic,"What you think of Jurassic World
LOVED IT, what about Fast Five?","Dude Vin Desiel was a beast in it!-I know everything was just exploding in that movie
What you think about Avengers: Infinity Wars?-Super stoaked about it
ME TOO
I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok
ME TOO MAN it's gonna be great
So many good movies coming out!"
Fiction,I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time today.,"Wow, that is a real classic cult action film.-It was nothing like what I expected.-John Travolta is brilliant in that movie.-He was like this cool contract killer, him and the other guy?-Samuel L. Jackson?-Yes!-When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense.-Then ended up shooting the guy any way.-Yes!-I liked how all the stories bled into one another.-Yes, but some characters never even met.-Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,"
Con,Did you ever see Con Air?,Probalby my favorite Nicholas Cage film.-That movie had everyone!-Even Dave Chapelle.-He was so funny!-Who played the main villian?-Cyrus?-Yeah.-John Malcovich.-That right!
John,We just watched John Wick 2 the other night.,"Really, is it on HBO?-No we rented the DVD.-It was great.-I loved the first one.-Well the second one is just as good.-Same people in it?-Well of course John Wick, and the man in charge of The Continental.-I like that actor, what's his name?-I think Ian McShane.-Thats him, he's a great actor."
What,What's your favorite action movie that is based on a television show?,"That would be The Fugitive.-Is that the Harrisson Ford film from the 90s?-Yep, that's the one.-That is a great film and I especially enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's character.-I agree, he was fantastic.-Did you know that he improvised the line, ""I don't care!""?-I think I had heard that before.-It's a great line.-Let's not forget about Harrisson Ford either.-He was excellent as well.-I think he was good, but not great."
Patrick,Did you like any of Patrick Swayzes action films?,"Like Ghost?-No, that is a romance.-I mean like Point Break.-With Keanu Reeves?-That one.-I think it was a cool like surfer action one.-I liked that the bad guys were all sporty.-They were not that bad of bad guys too.-The people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them.-I think that was just good acting on their parts."
